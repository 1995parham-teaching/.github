## Introduction

Here, we offer materials on a variety of courses ranging from C programming to Go, along with documentation and more.
You are encouraged to contribute and utilize these resources on your learning journey. Specifically, Parham specializes in teaching programming concepts, while Elahe is passionate about machine learning and data science.

Please feel free to share any comments or raise issues concerning these repositories. Many include hands-on projects which provide insight into how we’ve tackled some popular challenges.
You’re invited to explore and attempt implementing solutions on your own.

Keep in mind that programming does not adhere to a one-size-fits-all set of rules; therefore, you might find some of our solutions differ from your preferred approaches.
In such instances, we encourage you to follow the method that works best for you or your team. Additionally, we would love to learn about your unique solutions, so don’t hesitate to inform us by posting an issue.
