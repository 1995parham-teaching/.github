## Introduction

Here I have materials on different courses from C programming to Go,
documentation etc. Feel free to contribute and also use
them in your learning journey.

Please let me know if you have any comments or issues about these repositories.
Many of these repositories are hands-on projects and you can use them to see
how I solved some popular challenges and also try to implement them by yourself.

Programming doesn't have rules so you may not agree with the way I solved a problem,
in those cases please stick to your way (or your team way). Also, you can let me know
about your way by posting an issue.
